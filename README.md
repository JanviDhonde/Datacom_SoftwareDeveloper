# Datacom_SoftwareDeveloper
I recently completed Datacom's Software Development Job Simulation on Forage, where I reviewed a web application, identified and fixed bugs, and planned future improvements. This experience enhanced my skills in critical thinking, root cause analysis, and software development. I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world projects.
